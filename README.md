# String utilities(written in Rust)

## Features:

- String to Hex Color Generator

It takes a string as input and generates a unique and reproducible hexadecimal color code (e.g., `#RRGGBB`). It's useful for assigning consistent colors to tags, usernames, categories, etc., based on their names. However, I presonally created this for file names.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust and Cargo:** You need the Rust toolchain, which includes `rustc` (the compiler) and `cargo` (the build tool and package manager). See [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Compilation

To create a **debug build** for a faster compilation, less optimized executable,

```bash
cargo build
```
